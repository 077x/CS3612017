#All code was tested in Microsoft Visual Studio

#Type range(5) in the interpreter, what does the interpreter return?
#So what does 'for i in range(5)' mean?
print("\nExercise 4:\n")
#In the interpreter:
#range(5) -> Prints range(0, 5), which is an iteration of i from start (inclusive) to stop (exclusive) by step. Start defaults to 0

#Type 'type(range(5)) in the interpreter:
#type(range(5)) -> Prints <class 'range'>
